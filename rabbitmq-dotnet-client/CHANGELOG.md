## Changes Between 6.0.0 and 6.1.0

This release continues with improvements to memory use and object allocations.

A full list of changes can be found in the GitHub milestone: [`6.1.0`](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-dotnet-client/milestone/48?closed=1).

## Changes Between 5.2.0 and 6.0.0

This major release of this client introduces substantial improvements
in terms of memory footprint and throughput. They come at the cost
of minor but important **breaking API changes** covered below.

The client now requires .NET Framework 4.6.1 or .NET Standard 2.0.
Earlier versions are no longer supported by the `6.x` series.

Key improvements in this release have been the result of hard work by
our stellar community members (in no particular order): @stebet, @bording,
@Anarh2404, @danielmarbach, and others.

A full list of changes can be found in the GitHub milestone: [`6.0.0`](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-dotnet-client/milestone/41?closed=1).

### The Switch to System.Memory (and [Significantly Lower Memory Footprint](https://stebet.net/real-world-example-of-reducing-allocations-using-span-t-and-memory-t/) that Comes with It)

The client now uses the [`System.Memory` library](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Memory/) for message and command payloads. This significantly
reduces object allocation and GC pressure for heavy workloads but also
**potentially requires application changes**: consumer delivery payloads are now of instance [`System.ReadOnlyMemory<byte>`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.readonlymemory-1?view=netcore-3.1)
instead of `byte[]`.

While there's an implicit conversion for these types,
instances of `System.ReadOnlyMemory<byte>` **must be copied or consumed/deserialised before delivery handler completes**.
Holding on to delivered payloads and referencing them at a later point **is no longer safe**.

The same applies to publishers and the `IModel.BasicPublish` method: prefer using `System.ReadOnlyMemory<byte>`
over `byte[]` and dont' assume that this memory can be retained and used outside of the scope of the publishing
function.

GitHub issue: [#732](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-dotnet-client/pull/732)

### Timeouts Use `System.TimeSpan`

All timeout arguments now use `System.TimeSpan` values.

GitHub issue: [#688](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-dotnet-client/pull/688)

### Reduced Public API Surface

No major changes here but this is potentially breaking. Only public classes that were never meant
to be publicly used have been turned internal to the client.

GitHub issue: [#714](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-dotnet-client/issues/714)

### Requires .NET Framework 4.6.1 or .NET Standard 2.0

The client now requires .NET Framework 4.6.1 or .NET Standard 2.0. Earlier versions are no longer
supported.

GitHub issue: [#686](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-dotnet-client/issues/686)

### `Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource` Dependency Dropped

`Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource` dependency has been removed. It was an annoying
dependency to have for some environments.

### Source Linking

The library now supports source linking.

GitHub issue: [#697](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-dotnet-client/issues/697)

### NuGet Source Packages

Source packages are now also distributed via NuGet.

### CRL Checks for Server x.509 (TLS) Certificates

Added a TLS option to enforce CRL checks for server certificates.

GitHub issue: [#500](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-dotnet-client/pull/500)
